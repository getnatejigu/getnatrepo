# **Project Plan -- Team 31**

### 1. Introduction

The introduction provides context for the project. Write a concise description of the software you will develop and its target users.

The purpose of the software is to help college students analyze and improve their essay writing skills prior to submission for credit. This first release of the software should determine the average number of words per sentence in the essay. Since the students’ technical skills can vary greatly, the program should be as helpful as possible by providing sensible defaults, detailed usage instructions, and meaningful error feedback.

The software deliverable will be a command line application to which the student provides a path to their essay which resides in a raw text file. The application analyzes the essay and outputs the average number of words per sentence (rounded down to the nearest integer). The application will provide defaults for sentence delimiters (i.e. ‘.’, ’?’, and ’!’) and minimum word length (i.e. 3 characters/word), but also allows the user to override the defaults via the -d (sentence delimiters) and -l (word length) options.  To ensure the application is simple to deploy and run, it will be written in Java, use only the Java 1.7 libraries, and require no options to compile.
